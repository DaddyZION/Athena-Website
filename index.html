          <h3>üìâ Student Disengagement</h3>
          <p><strong>One in four pupils in England disengage</strong> when moving to secondary school. Students struggle with generic content that doesn't connect to their interests or future goals, leading to declining motivation and academic performance.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card">
          <h3>üò∞ Educator Burnout</h3>
          <p>Teachers face overwhelming workloads from <strong>administrative tasks, marking volumes, and staff shortages</strong>. This leaves less time for actual teaching and personalized student support, contributing to high turnover rates.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card">
          <h3>üéØ The Relevance Gap</h3>
          <p>Students feel <strong>unprepared for their futures</strong> as traditional education fails to develop real-world skills. The disconnect between academic learning and workforce demands leaves graduates ill-equipped for modern careers.</p>

        <h2>How Athena Transforms Education</h2>
        <p class="lead">Athena is an AI-powered application that allows teachers and students to curate personalized custom group coursework projects, mock exams, and tutorials‚Äîall tailored to individual interests.</p>
        
        <div class="solution-example">
          <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
          <p>A teacher wants to show their class how to integrate a function and apply it to real-world scenarios. Traditionally, the whole class learns from the same generic examples.</p>
          <p><strong>With Athena:</strong> The teacher specifies the topic using natural language‚Äîhow many examples they need and any specifications. Using sophisticated prompt engineering and state-of-the-art AI, Athena creates personalized lessons where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A student interested in sports sees integration applied to calculating distances in football</li>
            <li>A music enthusiast learns through sound wave analysis</li>
            <li>An aspiring engineer explores structural calculations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This frees the teacher's time to focus on helping students where they individually struggle, while students collaborate on diverse applications of the same core concept.</p>

        <h2>Athena</h2>
        
        <section class="modal-section">
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>The education sector is made up of many flaws and struggles, from students' struggling to be engaged and feeling unprepared for their futures, to teachers drowning in preparation work for their lessons and struggling to balance work and rest. This isn't a collection of separate issues but an interconnected, systemic crisis. Research quantifies the problem starkly: <strong>44% of K-12 teachers report feeling burned out "very often" or "always"</strong>, making it the most burned-out profession in the US [3]. Simultaneously, a "relevance gap" has opened between education and the workforce, with <strong>nearly half of recent graduates (48%) feeling unprepared to even apply for entry-level jobs</strong> in their field [4]. Our system will aim to aid schools in relieving these struggles, by generating exciting work based on students' unique interests, and freeing up teachers' time.</p>
          
          <p>Athena is an application which allows teachers and students to curate personalised custom group coursework projects, mock exams or tutorials. For example, if a teacher wants to show their class how to integrate a function and apply it to real world scenarios, usually the whole class would learn from the same examples. Using Athena, the teacher can specify using natural language the topic, how many different examples, as well as any specification they require, and using sophisticated prompt engineering and state of the art AI, Athena can create the lessons. Athena is used by both student and teacher allowing for easy integration into the classroom, including a learning coach to go through and help the students when they are struggling. This frees the teachers time to focus on helping the students where they individually get stuck and allows the students to collaborate on a more diverse set of applications for the given subject.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="modal-section">
          <h3>Engagement Deficit</h3>
          <p><strong>"One in four pupils in England 'disengage' when they move up to secondary school." [1]</strong></p>
          
          <p>This crisis of engagement is driven by standardized curricula that fail to connect with students. This creates a significant perception gap: while 63% of students report feeling highly engaged, only 45% of teachers agree, suggesting the reality is far more concerning than self-reports indicate [5]. Educational research identifies four key dimensions of engagement often missing in traditional models: <strong>relevance, autonomy, collaboration, and authenticity</strong> [6]. When students see a task as relevant to their interests, have control over their learning path, can work with peers, and tackle real-world problems, their motivation and performance increase significantly [6].</p>
          
          <p>A systemic issue deepens this problem. While 72% of teachers see "asking thoughtful questions" as the best sign of engagement, 54% of superintendents identify "performing well on assessments" as the top indicator [5]. This conflict forces teaching methods that are optimized for standardized tests, even when those methods are known to undermine the active, authentic learning that fosters deep understanding.</p>
          
          <h4>How would Athena help?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Athena will personalise the learning experience and this would assist students by personalising examples in ways which they can easily understand based on perhaps the already level of understanding and meeting the learning objectives. This directly fosters <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>autonomy</strong>, two of the core drivers of engagement.</li>
            <li>By doing the point above, it would help with taking a "burden" off the teachers, as it is automatically done, all they would have to do at the early stage would be to briefly check that the example given is suitable.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Possible Shortcomings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Athena may not be as engaging to students who have mitigating circumstances, no matter how much the work is structured towards their interests, if they have things that are distracting in their life, they may still not be engaged.</li>
            <li>"Pupils eligible for free school meals report lower levels of trust, enjoyment, and belonging; the gap widens as secondary school progresses." [1]</li>

          <h3>Student & Teacher Burnout & Inefficiencies</h3>
          <p><strong>"The main causes of heavy workload are:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>the volume of administrative tasks</li>
            <li>the volume of marking</li>
            <li>staff shortages</li>
            <li>lack of support from external specialist agencies such as for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), or behaviour</li>
            <li>challenging behaviour of pupils</li>
            <li>changes to external examinations</li>
            <li>frequently changing government policies and regulations</li>
            <li>in some cases, lack of skills or training" [2]</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The scale of the burnout crisis is alarming. A National Education Association (NEA) survey found that <strong>90% of members described burnout as a "very serious" or "somewhat serious" issue</strong> [3]. This has led to a mass exodus, with over 300,000 public school teachers and staff leaving their jobs between February 2020 and May 2022. A 2022 poll revealed <strong>55% of current teachers plan to leave the profession sooner than intended</strong> [3].</p>
          
          <p>A key driver of this overwhelming workload is the demand for <strong>differentiation</strong>‚Äîthe process of manually tailoring instruction for dozens of students with diverse learning needs [7]. This impossible burden creates a vicious cycle: disengaged students require more differentiation, which increases teacher workload and causes burnout. That burnout then reduces teaching quality, which further exacerbates student disengagement [8].</p>
          
          <h4>How would Athena help?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Athena would help teachers combat the heavy workload they have to deal with as a consequence of becoming a teacher. By automating the generation of personalized, project-based curricula, it directly tackles the unsustainable burden of <strong>manual differentiation</strong>.</li>
            <li>As a consequence of combating their heavy workload this will increase teacher satisfaction which creates external benefits for society this also means that teachers job retention will be higher as they would enjoy working in a school environment that's not dominated by admin related work - especially for the staff in school that are supposed to teach the students.</li>
            <li>This will mean that issues like staff shortages will also be diminished, as teachers will be happy with their role at school and it also makes staff shortage less of a problem as majority of the marking will not be done by teachers but by Athena. However, proof reading the marking will be required.</li>
            <li>Athena would help reduce the high volume of marking required from teachers. By automating assessment marking and tasking, it allows teachers to dedicate more time to activities such as developing improved teaching materials and providing personalised support to students, especially those who have mitigating circumstances.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Possible Shortcomings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The success of students is not fully determined by teachers. "Poor behaviour in the classroom ( low-level disruption, absenteeism, verbal abuse )" - stems from factors outside school, it includes the students home and socioeconomic status. This demonstrates that student achievement is influenced by a range of factors beyond the teachers control. [2]</li>
            <li>Considering that this will be a new addition in a school, it will mean that by trying to get rid of 'admin work' for teachers, it actually creates overall more admin work for the other staff, which can be argued is worse off, as the other staff in a school that manage will have a potentially worse wellbeing due to the high work load now they have to deal with.</li>
            <li>There are other causes of stress for both students and teachers [2]</li>

          <h3>Benefits and Features of Athena</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Centralisation of data:</strong> Compiles all data into a single repository, allowing a comprehensive view of student resources, progress and administrative operations. This reduces redundancy in data through streamlined operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves communication:</strong> This system promotes connectivity by creating a shared space where users are allowed to communicate through messages, comments, or by sharing feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Provides data-driven insights:</strong> The system allows users to manage their own learning plans, Consequently, the compilation of data on student activity provides real-time information to teachers, personal tutors and parents to monitor student performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Bridging the Relevance Gap:</strong> By grounding learning in authentic, student-chosen projects, Athena directly addresses the gap between academic skills and workforce demands. It helps solve the "paradox of preparation," where students learn timeless skills like critical thinking but can't demonstrate them in the practical, technical contexts employers use for screening. Students graduate not just with knowledge, but with a portfolio of tangible work that proves their competency.</li>
          </ul>
